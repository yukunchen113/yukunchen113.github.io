# About This Site:
Currently, its pretty empty here. <br>
## Plans:
I plan on adding my insights for each chapter of 
*The Elements Of Statistical Learning II*. I hope to 
make it easy to understand, and make it as intuitive as 
possible. I will be answer the question of *"Why did they do that?"*
and *"How does this make sense?"*

Future ideas will be added later on, including projects and personal
research ideas to tackle. 

The type of pages will be separated into notes, and projects. Where *notes* is a form of analysis (Textbooks, papers etc.) and *projects* is the implementation of various ideas.
