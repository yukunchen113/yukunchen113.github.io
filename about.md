# Hi, I'm Yukun!

I am a **final year Mechatronics Engineering** student at McMaster University. At McMaster, Mechatronics is mostly on the software side. We focus on **embedded software** and HDLs. I've also done mechanical work such as **robotics**, mechanical vibrations, and dynamics. In terms of the electrical side, along with HDLs (Verilog) we have worked with electrical instrumentation and electricity and magnetism. This year, I am excited to be taking courses in parallel computing and computer networks!

Personally, I have a strong interest in **Machine learning**. Ever since attending NeurIPS 2018, I have been interested in the **unsupervised learning of disentangled representations**. Though I have focused on unsupervised methods currently [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02230.pdf), it is mentioned that we should move from a passive learning style to an active one. I believe that finding proper representations
of your data is what will lead to efficient and scalable
[continual learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8193-life-long-disentangled-representation-learning-with-cross-domain-latent-homologies.pdf), hierarchical learning, and interpretability.

I am also interested in deep learning in general, and I'm always open to talking about it!


# About This Site:

### Plans:
I plan on adding my insights for chapters of 
*The Elements Of Statistical Learning II*. I hope to 
make it easy to understand, and make it as intuitive as 
possible. I will be answer the question of *"Why did they do that?"*
and *"How does this make sense?"*

Future ideas will be added later on, including projects and personal research ideas to tackle. 

I will also blog about things I find interesting!

# Some Non-Technical Facts About Me:
I like to play guitar, I've been playing guitar for quite a while. Since I started playing causally, my repertoire became quite limited!

One of my favourite sports is boxing, trained in boxing for a year and a half, while I was on coop at MDA. I needed to train my cardio and core, and boxing is a great sport for that. It also teaches how to remain relaxed under pressure, sparring in the ring is very different from bag work!

I also like to travel. Some of the places I have been to include Cuba, The Dominican Republic, US, England, France, Prague, Germany, Austria, and China. I've also road-tripped all around Canada.
