## Machine Learning for Canadarm2 Mission Planning
At MDA, I worked on a project to accelerate Canadarm2 mission planning. Current mission planning operations require running many time-consuming, physics-based, time-series simulations of Canadarm2 dynamics. These simulations allow us to identify suitable translational and rotational rates to maneuver the robotic arm, given various payloads. Under these rates and arm conditions, we have to make sure the forces and moments the arm undergoes meet an established safety criteria. I created and designed machine learning model testbeds and data pipelines to aid this process. Along with some data preparation, these models predict time histories of the load acting on the arm, given the payload mass properties and rate commands. This gives us accurate estimates of the optimal rate, in a fraction of the time it typically takes using current methods. This is the first project to use deep learning models to aid in mission planning, and will also be a demonstration to show the potential of using deep learning methods in future programs, reducing the costs and turnaround time of the simulation results without compromising the quality of results.
