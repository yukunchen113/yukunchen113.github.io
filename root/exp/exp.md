## Machine Learning for Canadarm2 Mission Planning

### Machine Learning Group, MDA Brampton
- Part of AI group at MDA brampton
- In free time, created pitch to director of engineering for the use of ML in company projects.
- Evaluated applications with AI group and created a detailed literature review of current state of the art
- Created presentations to be used in pitch

### Deep Learning for Canadarm2 Mission Analysis
- Created the first deep learning project to accelerate Canadarm2 mission planning.

##### Problem Tackled
- Current worst-case mission planning operations require running many time-consuming, simulations of Canadarm2 dynamics with various payloads to identify suitable speeds to maneuver the robotic arm 

##### Results of Successful Project
- Models predicts accurate estimates of the optimal rate to move the arm, given mass properties and arm commands.
- Predicted reduction in mission analysis time from 2-3 weeks down to 1-2 days.
- This is the first project to use deep learning models to aid in mission planning, and will also be a demonstration to show the potential of using deep learning methods in future programs

### Dragonfly NASA Tipping Point Project
- Worked with mechanical, electrical, controls, and software engineers on the end effector of the robotic arm for the NASA tipping point Dragonfly project, an on-orbit satellite self-assembly project. 
- Communicated to setup electrical testbed and wrote scripts to test if the end effector met the mechanical   requirements. 
- Proposed the methods learned to project manager, for a similar, separate project.
