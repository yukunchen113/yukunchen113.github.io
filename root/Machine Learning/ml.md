## [Notes on *The Elements of Statistical Learning*](/ml/ESLII/):<br>
My notes on ESLII, where I give my own take on some of the problems, and important key points in the book. I hope to go indepth into the different contents of the book. I believe the many of the methods are important in this era of Deep Learing, as a solid foundation. I have also coded some of the examples.

## [Information Theory](/ml/information_theory/): <br>
My notes on various aspects that I find regarding information theory. I'll try to give a summary of the different ideas, how they connect inwards to the other concepts learned about, and then give the reason for why this new idea is necessary. I'll also try to relate this back to machine learning.
