# Welcome to my site!

<br/>
My name is Yukun.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be posting explanations of projects,  
and various notes that I find useful and interesting! 

Please also check out my projects as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be posting my process as I learn new things. 
So, if you see anything that catches your attention,
Please feel free to contact me! <br/>
<br/>
My primary interests are in *Machine Learning*,
specifically *deep learning*. I find the idea of 
disentanglement and the recombination of disentangled 
representations fascinating. I hope to be doing work on 
this soon. I believe that finding proper representations
of your data is what will lead to efficient and scalable
continual learning, and interpretability. Specifically, I like to think about how we can model the world/the way we think.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also interested in *Robotics/Mechatronics*, specifically towards embedded software, and FPGAs.
