			<h1 id="hi-im-yukun">Hi, I’m Yukun!</h1>

<p>I am a <strong>final year Mechatronics Engineering</strong> student at McMaster University. At McMaster, Mechatronics is mostly on the software side. We focus on <strong>embedded software</strong> and HDLs. I’ve also done mechanical work in <strong>robotics</strong>, mechanical vibrations, and dynamics. In terms of the electrical side, along with HDLs (Verilog) we have worked with electrical instrumentation and electricity and magnetism. This year, I am excited to be taking courses in parallel computing and computer networks!</p>

<p>Personally, I have a strong interest in <strong>Machine learning</strong>. Ever since attending NeurIPS 2018, I have been interested in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations. Though I have focused on unsupervised methods currently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02230.pdf">this paper</a>, it is mentioned that we should move from a passive learning style to an active one. I believe that finding proper representations
of your data is what will lead to efficient and scalable
<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8193-life-long-disentangled-representation-learning-with-cross-domain-latent-homologies.pdf">continual learning</a>, hierarchical learning, and interpretability.</p>

<p>I am also interested in deep learning in general, and I’m always open to talking about it!</p>

<h1 id="about-this-site">About This Site:</h1>

<h3 id="plans">Plans:</h3>
<p>I plan on adding my insights for chapters of 
<em>The Elements Of Statistical Learning II</em>. I hope to 
make it easy to understand, and make it as intuitive as 
possible. I will be answer the question of <em>“Why did they do that?”</em>
and <em>“How does this make sense?”</em></p>

<p>Future ideas will be added later on, including projects and personal research ideas to tackle.</p>

<p>I will also blog about things I find interesting!</p>

<h1 id="some-non-technical-facts-about-me">Some Non-Technical Facts About Me:</h1>
<p>I like to play guitar, I’ve been playing guitar for quite a while. Since I started playing causally, my repertoire became quite limited!</p>

<p>One of my favourite sports is boxing, trained in boxing for a year and a half, while I was on coop at MDA. I needed to train my cardio and core, and boxing is a great sport for that. It also teaches how to remain relaxed under pressure, sparring in the ring is very different from bag work!</p>

<p>I also like to travel, I some of the places I have been to include Cuba, The Dominican Republic, US, England, France, Prague, Germany, Austria, and China. I’ve also road-tripped all around Canada.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture I took of a goat in Alberta:
